I am currently studying computer science and IT administration(eight out of ten cycles) at Mariano Galvez University, Guatemala.
Just some random guy who found and old PC with Counter Strike on it, although ive decided i would like to create videogames, along the way i found i liked being alone coding, or playing with stuff on the house, like hoocking up everything to the modem, finding the best spot for a PC, changing settings on home groups at Windows, and thats how i found myself enjoying about systems administration. :3

Ive developed functional/basic software with technologies like C#, Java SE,Java EE, relational databases, and had the oportunity to mount my own PC, which was at first for gaming, but it turned out as a server for my own use.

Im currently learning about HTML,CSS,Javascript, .NET and React. Most of it from online courses, selftought.

You can find me on social
